            </div>
            This talk will showcase good and bad examples of Python code. The idea is to learn to write Pythonic code. This is distinct from how beginners write Python code when they're coming from other languages such as Java or C. We'll also see examples that clarify the Zen of Python. Talk requires basic knowledge of Python. Talk is suitable for beginners and intermediate Python programmers.

            What is Software Engineering? Is it really engineering? How different is Software engineering from Mechanical or Civil Engineering? Will a comparison give us any useful insights? This talk is inspired by the classic <em>The Unwritten Laws of Engineering</em> by W. J. King, first published in 1944. It still continues to be in print. This talk is for everyone working in the software industry.

            Microservices are all in rage, no doubt because it has many benefits. But are there situations where adopting microservices is a bad idea? At Devopedia, our web app doesn't use microservices. We'll explain why we're not using it, when we'll think of using it and what's a possible migration path. This talk will introduce essential software design principles, monoliths, modular monoliths and more. This talk is suitable for all coders regardless of the programming language they use.

            Apple has recently announce native support for Reactive Programming with SwiftUI and Combine frameworks. 
            <b>SwiftUI</b> provides views, controls, and layout structures for declaring your app's user interface. The framework provides event handlers for delivering taps, gestures, and other types of input to your app, and tools to manage the flow of data from your app's models down to the views and controls that users will see and interact with.
            <b>Combine</b> framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. These values can represent many kinds of asynchronous events. Combine declares publishers to expose values that can change over time, and subscribers to receive those values from the publishers.        
            In this session, we'll develop a Weather App that fetches the latest weather using a Combine Publisher. The data is rendered on UI using the SwiftUI Subscribers.

              The Driving Forces for Micro Frontends

            While microservices got rid of backend monoliths, frontend monoliths remained a problem. Micro Frontends architecture attempts to fix this through transformational operating models. Micro Frontends is the way we think about and build feature changes. This talk would go deeper into the design approach in which a frontend app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent "microapps" working loosely together. We'll see how this benefits and empowers developers. We'll cover principles, possible architectures, challenges, horizontal/vertical split, team structures, automation pipeline and patterns.

            This talk will cover the essential steps to develop a complete web application. For the backend, we'll use Google's Firebase. For the frontend, we'll use HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We'll walkthrough a working codebase. We'll configure DNS for a custom domain. We'll learn what Firebase has to offer. In the process, beginners will learn to appreciate the web app development process. This talk is ideal for beginners, UI designers and frontend developers who wish to transition to fullstack development.

            Looker is a modern data platform in Google Cloud that lets you analyze and visualize your data interactively. You can use Looker to do in-depth data analysis, integrate insights across different data sources, build actionable data-driven workflows, and create custom data applications. Looker supports LookML (Looker Modeling Language) which is a proprietary language that is used to generate abstracted SQL and provides a modeling layer. Looker’s data visualizations and dashboards give you the flexibility to drill down into your data while maintaining a secure, birds-eye of the operations. In this session, we will discuss what Looker is, how to use Looker to visualize data, understand core LookML terms and concepts, and create views and build a dashboard with appropriate data views.
